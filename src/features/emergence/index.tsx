            This is my final year thesis.  It is based on the idea that cities are also organisms.
            And we can design the layers of systems in cities like organisms. Living in Dhaka,
            one of the most rapidly growing cities in the world, I certainly found out the necessity of sustainable growth of cities.
            In last 30 years, Dhakaâ€™s growth had a horrible impact on the environment and livability. To solve this issue we need a
            totally a new way of planning specifically for the unique landform and ecology of Dhaka. I used computational simulation methods to mimick 
            natural systems to optimize different layers of urban systems like landform, connectivity and zoning.

            Dhaka is one of the most densly populated cities in the
            world. It has rapid growth in last 30 years with steady
            decline in its wetland and natural landscapes. Though it has a very distinct geographical characteristic,
             main growth method is to landfill the wetlands and create iron-grid road pattern. But just outskirts of Dhaka shows us a 
             more organic form of settlement growth.

            If we compare the different systems of an organism with different system of a city, we can find a clear similarity.
            Circulation, resource cycle, positioning of organs, information system both city and organism has common.
            while the growth of the city is determined by brute force- landfill, the growth of an organism is the result of millions of years evolution.
            If we could optimize these system of the cities mimicking organic system, we could find more efficient solutions.

                  The highlands are surrounded by lower lands used for agriculture in the dry season. The water has fused in the nooks and crannies of the land.
